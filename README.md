FaceRecognitionUsingMLClassifier
📌 Project Summary

FaceRecognitionUsingMLClassifier is a Python-based facial recognition system that utilizes classical machine learning techniques along with OpenCV for image processing. The aim of this project is to detect and recognize human faces from images or video feeds using pre-trained or custom-trained ML classifiers.
🧠 Technologies Used

    Python

    OpenCV (cv2)

    NumPy

    Scikit-learn

    (Optional: Joblib for model persistence)

⚙️ Key Features

    Real-time face detection using OpenCV’s Haar cascades or DNN.

    Face data preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization).

    Feature extraction and model training using machine learning classifiers such as:

        Support Vector Machine (SVM)

        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        Logistic Regression

    Face recognition from webcam or image input.

    Model training pipeline with dataset directory structure support.

    Model evaluation and prediction.
